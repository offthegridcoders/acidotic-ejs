        <p>"In my mind, there was nothing tougher to accomplish in the (USATF-NE) series than the dreaded 40% grade of Upper Walking Boss in the Loon Mountain Race. No matter how hard I imagined it would be, once I was actually there, it was insane! Being up there on UWB, sweating it out with everyone, taking in the view, proving to myself I could do it . .. priceless."</p>
