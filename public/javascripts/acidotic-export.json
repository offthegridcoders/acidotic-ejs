The short course markings will be referred to as the 'safe route'. It is not the most direct route from CP to CP but it is 'safe' in that you can follow the flags and arrows. If you choose to race the short course you may still take any route you prefer from CP to CP. Completing the short course will make you eligible for 'mountain goat status' but there are no overall finishers awards.

          "copy" : "Fell running, also known as mountain running and hill running, is the sport of running and racing off road, over upland country where the gradient climbed is a significant component of the difficulty. The name arises from the origins of the English sport on the fells of northern Britain. Fell races are organized on the premise that contenders possess mountain navigation skills and carry adequate survival equipment as prescribed by the organizer. Modern fell running has common characteristics with cross country running. Courses are often longer, steeper, unmarked when out on the hills (with a few exceptions) and these longer races can demand mountain navigational techniques. Nevertheless, cross country seems fast and furious to many fell runners. Fell running also overlaps with orienteering. Courses are again longer but demand different techniques from orienteering. However, fell running does require navigational skills in a wild, mountainous environment, particularly in determining and choosing between routes. [adapted from Wikipedia]",

That's why the Northeast Snowshoe Federation was formed. It's mission is to promote and the grow the sport of snowshoe racing here in the northeast and host a regional championship every winter. This winter, we here in New Hampshire are THRILLED to host the event! Next winter it'll rotate to another location in the region. And to increase the competitiveness (and the fun) we will combine the New Hampshire championship with this regional finale. So, the Granite State Snowshoe Series participants have a championship of their own and the regional snowshoe racing family gets a chance to come together in one grand race!",
