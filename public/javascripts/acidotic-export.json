            "content" : "Fell running, also known as mountain running and hill running, is the sport of running and racing off road, over upland country where the gradient climbed is a significant component of the difficulty. The name arises from the origins of the English sport on the fells of northern Britain. Fell races are organized on the premise that contenders possess mountain navigation skills and carry adequate survival equipment as prescribed by the organizer. Modern fell running has common characteristics with cross country running. Courses are often longer, steeper, unmarked when out on the hills (with a few exceptions) and these longer races can demand mountain navigational techniques. Nevertheless, cross country seems fast and furious to many fell runners. Fell running also overlaps with orienteering. Courses are again longer but demand different techniques from orienteering. However, fell running does require navigational skills in a wild, mountainous environment, particularly in determining and choosing between routes. [adapted from Wikipedia]",

The lava making up the park has long cooled, but your legs will be burning. This particular area of Pawtuckaway has gone unraced for too long so join us in what will be one of the most talked about trail races of the year.   This is a rugged trail race who's distance and elevation profile combine for a very challenging test even for the fittest endurance athlete. Make no mistake about it, the course travels along hiking trails with sections that must be negotiated very carefully. Run at the peak of NH foliage make sure to steal a peek or two at the highest elevations...it'll be worth the effort.  There will be at least two manned aid stations with water along the course.",

We have designed two courses that maximize the best of what this amazing landscape has to offer.   The \"long course\" will ascend Mt.

But don't let the easy terrain fool you...we've planned some technical singletrack in the final few miles.  The \"short course\" will skip the big climb to the summit of Mt. Roberts but both courses will finish on the famous Brook Walk Trail.  This roughly half mile trail is some of the most rugged singletrack on the course and passes by seven spectacular waterfalls.",

Emerson School is accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs. Emerson's classrooms and woodland playground create a beautiful space that is rich in potential. Their curriculum is shared and created by both teachers and children working together. They believe that children learn best through what they do best - through their play. Their teachers closely observe children's play and then offer further opportunities for children to reflect on and revisit their experiences. Emerson School's uniqueness results from relationships between families, teachers, and a parent volunteer Board of Directors. These partnerships have been the essence of Emerson for over 40 years and the key to their continued success.",

This year, however, the race is a qualifier for the US Mountain Running Team which will compete in Italy at the World Mountain Running Championships (WMRC) in September.  At the WMRC, men and women race different distances much like they do at World Cross Country Events.  The US Team has learned over the years that the best way to be competitive at Worlds is to have qualifying courses that simulate the WMRC course in surface, elevation and distance. The recent podium finishes of US mens and womens teams since 2006 has supported this thinking.  While the courses are of different lengths, the prize money for the championships is equally distributed among the men and women as we always believe women should have the same prize earnings opportunity as men.

For the safety of our volunteers, competitors, and family a final determination on the status of our races will be made the Thursday prior to each race. The status of the race (\"ON\" or \"POSTPONED\") will be detailed on each individual race webpage. You must check each race webpage prior to the race to assure the race will be held. Every attempt will be made to reschedule all postponed events. Pre-registered competitors will be given a refund or rain check.",
